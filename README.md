This was quite difficult, but enjoyable. The most challenging parts were getting my operator() function to work, and to not have my calculator using previous results in new equations. I spent a lot of time fiddling with that function, as well as the event listeners for my operators and equals button. And I spent a lot of time putting in math equations. ðŸ˜… I did need a bit of help with this, but I think I did well!
